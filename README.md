Hermes is a JavaScript engine optimized for fast start up of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) apps. It features ahead-of-time static optimization and compact bytecode. This repo is Microsoftâ€™s fork of [facebook/hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes) and brings Hermes support to [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows).

The following commands should get you going in a Windows Command Prompt:

```shell
mkdir hermes-windows-workingdir
cd hermes-windows-workingdir
git -c core.autocrlf=false clone https://github.com/microsoft/hermes-windows.git
python hermes-windows/utils/build/configure.py --build-system="Visual Studio 16 2019" --cmake-flags="-A x64" --distribute
cd build_release
MSBuild.exe ALL_BUILD.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release
```

You will now be in a directory with the output of building Hermes into CLI tools. From here you can run a piece of JavaScript as follows:

```shell
echo 'use strict'; function hello() { print('Hello World'); } hello(); | .\bin\Release\hermes.exe
```
